Best is a destination. Better is a commitment.

Best is also temporary. Let's see how.

Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all time, or is he? Mike is nearly 60 years old. Mike isn't the best basketball player any longer. Perhaps he was but these days even some elite college players would run literal circles around him. I don't even have to guess this. It was already starting to happen when he played for the Washington Wizards and that was when he was in his late 30s! 20 years on, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of high school players would give him trouble. Of course, I'm referring to his ability to compete playing basketball, not compare trophies or accolades.

Contrast that with Apple and Gateway Computers. (I realize comparing companies to a person is not exactly fair but there's a point here).

In the 90s, Gateway Computers outsold Apple. At the time, you could consider Gateway the "best" computer company of these two. We all know the history. Who even *is* Gateway Computers in the 2022? Have you even heard of them before now?

Apple doesn't compete to be the best. Apple competes to beat, well, Apple. I'd argue this became espeically true after Steve Jobs came back to Apple after  NeXT Computers. Over the lifespan of Apple we have seen constant reinvention of what they do and how they define themselves. Apple is committed to being better.

The same was true for Michael Jordan. Tony Robbins likes to remind people that MJ didn't compete with others, he competed with what his best possibly could be... until he couldn't. Let's not take way from his amazing accomplishments because those are still unmatched in nearly all sports. But typically when MJ is being compared to modern players, they talk about "in his prime" as in when he was still good, as in he's no longer good.

This is *not* a slight toward MJ. How he approached his life's work has impacted me in so many ways. Like so many kids growing up in the 90s, I too, wanted to be like mike. To me, MJ will always be the greatest of all time.

But even if I *feel* like he's the GOAT, that doesn't make it true. MJ *was* the best player. Now, someone is better. 

This is all to say that:

Better is better than best.
