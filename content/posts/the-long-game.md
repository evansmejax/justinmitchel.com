[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/) is one of the most prolific content creators in the world. He's written a blog post every day for 10+ years. Think of that, every day for 10+ years. How does one even accomplish such a feat?

Well, I'd argue that Seth understand the long game better than most. He looks at writing as not just a part of his practice but a part of who he is. His writing happens because, as he puts it, "it's today." 

He writes because it's *today*. 

We all routinely do things every day because it's *today*. I ate this morning. I will sleep later today. I will spend time with my family. I do a lot of things automatically just because it's *today*. 

The trick is turning an aspiration into a habit so your aspirational version of yourself becomes actually who you are. 

James Clear's book, [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3QLiLFK), is a great resource to start shifting your mindset. For example, "I am a runner" vs "I a want to be a runner". The former defines *who you are* while the latter tells us who you want to be. Runners run. Wannabe runners don't... yet.

We know this subconsciously. How we communicate to ourselves informs how we act: *I can do this* vs *I can't do this*. *I am* vs *I want to be*.

How many times have you actually done something that you keep telling yourself *I can't do this* vs *I can do this*?  It's usually when there's self belief you get it done.

The long game is a commitment to yourself to become more of who you truly are. This commitment is not deterred by setbacks or what others say. If you told me I am a person who does not sleep, it would have literally no effect on me because it's definitely note true. If for some reason, I do not sleep tonight I surely will very soon.

The aspirations for ourselves can and should change, but the commitment to becoming more of who we are must remain.
