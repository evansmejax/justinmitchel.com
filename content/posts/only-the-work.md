What if all you did, besides eat and sleep, was focus on your work?

All the books you that read are with the goal of enriching your work. 
All the videos you watch, enrich your work. 
All the conversations you have, enrich your work. 
All the things you listen to, enrich your work?

What things would need to be cut? 

Perhaps it's the things that need to be cut, are the things you should cut right away. And when you face things you truly value, your intern monologue will immediately dismiss the noting of cutting that activity. 

Focus on what you value, cut out the rest.
