Let's say every day you spend 100 minutes consuming content. That's maybe 2 episodes of The Bear, 1 of the office, and 1 parks and rec. 

Of these 100 minutes, what if, using a timer, you created content for 20 minutes?

Pen to paper. Every day. Creating new content for 20 minutes. 

Once the timer ends, back to consuming content. 

"But Justin," you say, "I create content for a living."

If that's actually true. Spend 20 minutes creating something new that you've always wanted to create but haven't found the time. 

Most people won't spend the 20 minutes per day. But you're not most people, are you?
