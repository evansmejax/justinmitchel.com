# Popcorn Head
In college I was bestowed with the nickname *Popcorn Head* meaning I have all kinds of ideas overflowing out of my head.

At the time, I'm like I love popcorn and I'm like, to my prof, obviously you don't like that I am a popcorn head.

To troll him, I named my senior thesis project "Popcorn Head Productions."

But the thing is, *ideas* are important. Why else would book burning be such a radical symbol?

This website is my attempt at diving deeper into my ideas and doing something with them. 

There's a consensus among entrepreneurs (especially tech ones) that *execution* is more important than *ideas* or, *execution* is everything and ideas are not.

But isn't *execution* just a commitment to bring ideas to life and while doing so get more ideas and thus continue to bring ideas to life? I don't the answer. Maybe Elon does.

There's a whole other side to ideas and that's *selling* people on yours. I am sure many people would bundle *selling* with *execution* but I think it's something different. I actually think that *selling* is merely a form of sharing. 

Everyone has good ideas. 

Let's see if I can find and share some.

Cheers,
