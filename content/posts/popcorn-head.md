There's a consensus among entrepreneurs (especially tech ones) that *execution* is more important than *ideas* -- ideas are cheap and easy.

Ideas are *not* cheap and easy. Yeah sure, one or two here and there are cheap and easy. You can do that right now with little effort. You probably have at least one business idea right?

But how about 100? 200? 500? 1,000?

I don't know about you but I don't know if I could come up with 1,000 original ideas right here and now. 

This makes execution that much more difficult. What road to take? Which idea is best? Perhaps your friends or family know? Perhaps your mentors? Perhaps the market?

Think of an idea that you haven't shared online and share it. Post a video if you don't like writing. Or do the opposite. 

After you do that, come up with another idea and share it too. Rinse and repeat.

Find a business you like and think to yourself, "how would I run this? What would I do to improve this business?" Share those ideas. Send them to the people who work there. Don't be offended if they don't listen. They probably won't. 

Find another business. And another. And another.

Over time your ideas will improve.

After a while, the desire to make the idea real becomes a calling, a force of nature pulling you into the fold to make it happen, to bring the idea to life, to share it with the world.

Be prolific with your ideas. 

If you're lucky, you'll find an idea that pulls you in; an idea that keeps pulling you in and keeps your mind and your energy focused.
