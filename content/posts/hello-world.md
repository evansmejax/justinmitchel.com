Hello there. I'm Justin Mitchel. I decided to start writing on this website. Nearly 15 years ago, when I bought this domain, I wrote a bunch of articles but then one day just stopped and I am not sure why.

Seth Godin was once asked why he writes an article daily, he said something of the effect: "Because it's today."

I am a parent of 3 kids and a husband. I am a technologist, teacher, entrepreneur, an engineer, and just generally a student of life. 

Thanks for reading and I hope to see you again soon.

Cheers,

Justin
