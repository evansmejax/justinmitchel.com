Are you f*ck yeah about doing what you're about to do? Then the answer is no. The answer should always be no.

Here's a few examples:
- Get invited to a project?
- Get offered a new job? 
- Asked to join a new business? 
- Asked to lunch or coffee to chat?
- Invited to be a guest on a podcast?
- Need to do taxes?

If it's not a __HELL YEAH!__ it's a **no** or at least it should be a no when it certainly can be.

If you're making $20k/year, you are going to have to do your chores regardless of the scale of your feeling of __HELL YEAH!__ or **no**.

To me, there's a few concepts at play here:
- Derek Sivers's concept and article discussing [Hell Yeah! or No](https://sive.rs/hellyeah) and even the [book](https://sive.rs/n) about it. 
- Naval Ravikant's assertion that he doesn't do any task that that cost less than his [hourly wage](https://nav.al/hourly-rate). For example, if the task costs $150/hr to outsource it that's what he chooses since Naval set his hourly wage north of $5k/hr. Thi might be a great way to build wealth for yourself as well.
- Time. Many people have written on the topic and how it's absolutely our most precious resource. It's the one thing we simply cannot get more of. You cannot *earn* more time like you can *earn* more of money, status, prestige, skills, etc. Saying yes to things that you should say *no* to is time you will never get back.

There's another aspect that's not always discussed as it relates to __HELL YEAH!__ or **no** and that's *fear*. Many people will say **no** because they are simply **afraid of the result** of saying yes.

This *fear* might be the exact reason you need to say yes. *Fear* of failure is the easiest way to lean into always saying *no* but that's when regret will start to fill your life. Regret over a long period of time is the ultimate spirit crusher.

If you're afraid of the result (assuming you're not truly endangering yourself or others), making a choice that scares you should be an immediate answer of __HELL YEAH!__. I'd argue there's not a single successful person in this world that hasn't embraced fear in their pursuit of excellence. 

If I remember correctly, Steve Jobs was notoriously more proud of the things they (Apple) said no to then the things they said yes to. 

Remember, in life and in business a *lot* of opportunity can come your way if you let it. Saying yes to things that are less than you're calling is a form of cheating yourself now and in the future.
