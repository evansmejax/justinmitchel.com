> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  -- Steve Jobs at his famous [Stanford Commencement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) speech.
 
Every decision you make comes down to two possible scenarios: it's either __HELL YES!__ or it's no. Put another way, if you don't feel incredibly pulled or excited about saying __YES!__, then say no.

I first heard this concept from Derek Sivers in [his article](https://sive.rs/hellyeah) and then his [his book](https://sive.rs/n). Both are fantastic and worth a read.

Naval Ravikant set his [hourly wage](https://nav.al/hourly-rate) at $5,000/hr. Anything that costs less than $5,000/hr he outsources to someone else. Naval essentially outsources everything then. For reference, $500/hr (without taxes/fees) is about $1 million per year assuming 2,000 hours of work.

- Shop for groceries? No. 
- Get your car washed? No.
- Do the dishes? No. 
- Go to Vegas for a friend's birthday? No. 

There's a huge hidden cost to things that you say yes to. It's only *hidden* because you *have to* spend your time in some way. There's also the reality that you can't say *no* to doing dishes unless you actually have an alternative in place and you can *afford* that alternative.

The goal is not to be a selfish prick. 
The goal is to fight vigoursly for the things that truly matter to you. To fight against the things that waste your time and attention.

- Do you want to read to your kids before bed? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want make dinner with your daughters after they asks? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to go shopping with your cousin who is visiting for a few days? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to go to Lake Como in Italy for a friend's birthday? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to go to go-kart racing after work on friday? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to work hard to help your family enjoy a great life? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to learn as much as you can to enrich your own life? __HELL YEAH!__
- Do you want to share what you learned with others? __HELL YEAH!__

The hidden cost of almost everything is how much time you spend on it. Before long, you'll have no more time. Before long, you *will not* get to do the things you've been putting off.

Are you with me?
